Approach:
Find the middle of the list:

Use the slow and fast pointer approach to find the middle of the linked list. This involves having two pointers, one moving one step at a time (slow), and the other moving two steps at a time (fast). When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle.
Reverse the second half of the list:

After finding the middle, reverse the second half of the list. This can be done by iterating through the second half of the list and reversing the next pointers of the nodes.
Merge the two halves alternately:

Once the second half is reversed and split from the first half, merge the two halves alternately by adjusting the next pointers of the nodes. Start with the first node of the first half and the first node of the reversed second half, then proceed to the second node of each half, and so on, until both halves are merged.â€‹
