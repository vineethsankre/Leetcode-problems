### Approach using a hash table:

1. **Create an empty hash table** to store elements and their indices.
2. **Iterate through the array** from left to right.
3. For each element `nums[i]`, calculate the complement by subtracting it from the target: `complement = target - nums[i]`.
4. **Check if the complement exists** in the hash table. If it does, we have found a solution.
5. If the complement does not exist in the hash table, **add the current element** `nums[i]` to the hash table with its index as the value.
6. **Repeat steps 3-5** until we find a solution or reach the end of the array.
7. If no solution is found, **return an empty array** or an appropriate indicator.
